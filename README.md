# Page-Replace-Algo-Simulator

## Description
```This is a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) simulator** to test and compare different **page replacement algorithms** in operating systems.  
```
It supports three algorithms:

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
- **Optimal**

The simulator calculates **page hits, misses, and hit/miss ratios** based on user input.

---

## Features
- CLI-based, no GUI required.
- Supports any number of frames and page reference strings.
- Provides simple **performance metrics** for understanding algorithm efficiency.

## How to Run
1. Open terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd Path/To/Page-Replace-Algo-Simulator
